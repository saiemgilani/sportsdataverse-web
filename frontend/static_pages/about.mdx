The first conversation on the SportsDataverse projects happened at the [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/2021/). The paper our lead engineer, Saiem Gilani, wrote for the conference was selected as the winner for the Data and Software contribution, Open Track for their reproducible research competition.

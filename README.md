This is the code of my [personal blog](https://sportsdataverse.org).

Generally would describe the stack as Next.js, React.js using TypeScript and Material UI.

There is a [series of articles](https://sportsdataverse.org/blog/blog-with-next-js-react-material-ui-and-typescript) on my blog describing how this project works under the hood, so if you are interested, have a look there.

## Executing this project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
